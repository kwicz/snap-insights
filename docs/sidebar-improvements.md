# Sidebar Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the SnapInsights sidebar for better user experience and visual consistency.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Tooltip Enhancements
- **Increased padding**: Changed from `6px 10px` to `8px 14px` for better readability
- **Simplified text**: Removed the word "Mode" from all tooltips
  - "Snap Mode" → "Snap"
  - "Annotate Mode" → "Annotate"
  - "Transcribe Mode" → "Transcribe"
  - "Start Journey Mode" → "Start Journey"

### 2. Hover-Based Menu Interaction
- **Trigger**: Menu now opens on hover instead of click
- **Animation style**: Changed from slide-down to stretch animation
  - Menu appears to stretch/expand from the header button
  - Uses `scaleY` transform with proper transform-origin
  - Smooth transition for natural feel

### 3. Dynamic Header Icon
- **Active mode display**: When a mode is active, its icon replaces the SnapInsights logo in the header
- **Default state**: SnapInsights logo shown only when no mode is active
- **Visual feedback**: Users can quickly identify the active mode at a glance
- **Icon consistency**: Active mode icon in header matches the selected mode button

## Technical Implementation

### Animation Details
- Transform origin set to `top center` for stretch effect
- Scale animation from `scaleY(0)` to `scaleY(1)`
- Hover detection with 200ms delay to prevent accidental triggers
- Mouse leave detection to auto-close menu

### Icon Management
- Dynamic icon swapping based on `activeMode` state
- Maintains consistent styling (white icon on blue background)
- Smooth transitions between icon changes

## User Benefits
1. **Clearer tooltips**: More readable with better spacing and simpler text
2. **Faster access**: No click required, just hover to see options
3. **Better visual feedback**: Always know which mode is active via header icon
4. **Smoother animations**: Natural stretch effect feels more connected
5. **Reduced cognitive load**: Icon in header provides immediate mode recognition
